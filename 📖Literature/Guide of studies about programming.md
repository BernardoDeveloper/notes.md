Every dasy try solve *Leetcode* problems algorithms
Read the book: **# Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people**

Learn the following data structures:
1. Array
2. LinkedList
3. Queue
4. Stack
5. Binary Tree
6. Hashmap
7. Graph

Has two forms to learn about this, first is search in the google and the second is the free course of [The Primeagen](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)

> To *Leetcode* it's verify import know about **Big O**

I need underst the type of problems, for example in *Binary Trees* all the things I can solve with DFS or BFS (depth first search vs breadth first search)

**Atention:** if I don't know the problem I **don't** need stay in this problem by hours "don't broke your brain"

**Understand the problems with:**
1. DFS (Depth First Search)
2. BFS (Breadth First Search)
3. Sliding Window
4. Backtracking
5. Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci)
6. Hasmap
7. Two Pointer
